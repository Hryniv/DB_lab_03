Apollo, which we used in #3 (if I remember right), has a really pungent nose. almost garlicy. Bravo is much more mellow, kind of lemony. They are both bred from a Galena variety to be high-alpha (around 16%) but much more stable in storage. We bittered the beer with Apollo and Zeus in the first wort, then added some Galena, Goldings, and Bravo at 30 minutes, and Simcoe, Goldings, and Bravo at 5 minutes for aroma. Then we dryhopped it with some Goldings and Amarillo. The old calculations say it's over 100 IBUs, which makes us happy.",t

Hijos de Rivera uses the term here to refer to the mixture of four traditionally floor-malted Czech barley malts which they use to brew this excellent lager. Pouring very dark brown – approaching black – with reddish flashes, 1906 Black Coupage offers up a wonderful aroma. Look for richly bready notes with toast, touches of licorice, raisin and dried figs, hints of coffee grounds and cocoa powder, and an overlay of lightly fruity and floral hop character. This brew isn't shy on the palate either; there's quite a roasty character, with notes of deeply toasted bread, roasted coffee, and hints of dark chocolate and nuts. Those dried fruit notes emerge in the flavor too, augmented by Sladek hops which often contribute a fruity note akin to peach along with a spiciness similar to Saaz hops.",f

We wanted to re create the process in this beer,l (minus the major funk) by developing lactic acid and matching that with the breadiness of Sonoran White Wheat, and the unique profile of French Saison Yeast.

In the early 19th century, Scotch whiskey drinkers were well aware of the high quality of malt produced in Scotland, and the burgeoning whiskey market presented an abundance of barley. In turn, brewers decided to craft ales with very high malt bills, thus yielding the strong, malty, and sweet flavors that have become hallmarks of the Scottish Ale style. By the mid-19th century, Edinburgh was acknowledged as one of the foremost brewing cities in the world, a fact that any proud Scotsman would be honored to flaunt. The flavor of this rich, full-bodied ale stems from the malt profile, which exhibits complex notes of roasted and caramelized barley, dried dark fruit, chocolate, toasted nuts, and a faint hint of smoke.",t
